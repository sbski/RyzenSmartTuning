# RyzenSmartTuning
A utility for making Ryzen mobile APUs run faster. We are currently looking at the feasability of doing this. Currently you must have AMD uProf installed inorder to compile. (might not actually not sure at this point) 
You can install uProf here: https://developer.amd.com/amd-uprof/
Right now you will need FlyGoat's amazing RyzenAdj found here: https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj
