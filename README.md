# RyzenSmartTuning
An application for making Ryzen mobile APUs run faster. Research into the Ryzen Mobile SMU and it's operations.

## Goals
* To create a powerful yet easy to use application for allowing AMD Ryzen Mobile to draw more power .
* To make this form of *overclocking* easier and safer.
* To grasp a deeper understanding of how the SMU works on AMD Ryzen Mobile.

## Requrements:
* 64-bit Windows (built to run on Windows 10)
* AMD's uProf for the drivers 
  * You can install AMD's uProf Software [here](https://developer.amd.com/amd-uprof/)
* RyzenAdj is reccomended.
* AMD Ryzen Mobile Processor
  * Zen and Zen+ are better supported than Zen 2 based APUs
  * Should also work on Zen based Athlon mobile systems.
