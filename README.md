# RyzenSmartTuning
A utility for making Ryzen mobile APUs run faster. We are currently looking at the feasability of doing this but right now it looks good. Currently, We work with visual studios but if anyone wants to give it a shot outside of that, all the neccisary files are included. You might need to have AMD's uProf software installed inorder to compile. 
You can install uProf here: https://developer.amd.com/amd-uprof/
Right now you will need FlyGoat's amazing RyzenAdj found here: https://github.com/FlyGoat/RyzenAdj
